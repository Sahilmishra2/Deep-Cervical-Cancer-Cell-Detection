# Deep-Cervical-Cancer-Cell-Detection
Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning principles, our project aims to classify diverse cell types in deep cervical cancer. By harnessing cutting-edge technology, we strive to enhance diagnostic accuracy, paving the way for more targeted treatments and improved patient outcomes in cervical cancer management.
To use this project: 
1)You'll need python3 to run the program. 
2)I've included the preprocessed image data. 
3)Use pip install package-name to install the below packages. 
4)ou need to have the following python packages installed 
       ->keras 
       ->tensorflow (Both CPU or GPU version should do) 
       ->PIL 
       ->numpy
